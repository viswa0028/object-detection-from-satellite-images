# Object Detection from Satellite Images using ResNet

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting and classifying objects in satellite images using a deep learning approach based on the ResNet (Residual Network) architecture. Satellite imagery analysis is crucial for applications like environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management. This project builds a robust object detection pipeline optimized for high-resolution aerial images.

## Features
- Advanced object detection using ResNet backbone
- Preprocessing of satellite imagery (resizing, normalization, and augmentation)
- Transfer learning and fine-tuning for better performance
- Visualization of detected objects with bounding boxes
- High accuracy and efficiency in detecting multiple object categories

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- OpenCV for image processing
- NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for result visualization

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/satellite-object-detection.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd satellite-object-detection
```

## Usage
1. Prepare and preprocess your satellite image dataset.
2. Train the ResNet-based object detection model.
3. Use the model to detect objects in new satellite images.

Example:
```python
from detector import detect_objects

image_path = "path/to/satellite_image.jpg"
results = detect_objects(image_path)
results.show()
```

## Results
The model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on satellite image datasets and successfully identifies objects like buildings, vehicles, and natural formations.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with more advanced architectures like EfficientDet and YOLO
- Deployment as a web app for real-time object detection
- Support for multi-class object detection
